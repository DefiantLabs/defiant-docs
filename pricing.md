Redpoint arbitrage service

## Free Tier
Free tier provides users the ability to explore and try out the defiant swap API. The service will allow any client to ask: “is there an arb opportunity if I do this trade”? The Service will respond yes or no, show the value of the arb, and provide a link on how to purchase the tx to execute. For example, you ask us to calculate how much arbitrage would be available after a user swaps 5000 OSMO for Akash (or specifying the exact trade pools, if you know them). Our service would respond Yes, and say, there is 40 free osmo available ($52.18 USDC), and provide a link on how to pay for this.

## Cost Details
Defiant charges up front for arb info.  We charge 15% of the total profit we can deliver.  Using the example above, to purchase the 40 free osmo, defiant would charge $7.827 USDC and guarantee you get the full 40 osmo at an 85% discount.

## On Demand Access
On demand access will allow a user to purchase a single arbitrage opportunity.  This is ideal for users who do few trades and just want to try out the service.  If you are a power user, or a large service provider like a DEX or Wallet consider our credit-based Service to save on chain fees.

## Credit Based Access
Credit based access will allow a user to save on chain fees by allowing you to pay upfront in bulk for arb opportunities.  For example, you could pay $300 USDC, and you would be credited with $2,000 of free arb opportunity. (300/.15). This is good for users who do high trading volume and want to save on fees and have fast execution.

## Refunds & Guarantees
Defiant guarantees the executions will be profitable.  If you execute the transaction you paid for and it does not result in the expected profit, we will refund the difference.  All you have to do is submit the failed transaction hash to our customer support, or our automated refund API.
