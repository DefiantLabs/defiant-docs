Defiant has expert knowledge in managing cosmos infrastructure and developing cosmos-sdk oriented tools. We have helped many great teams including, the Interchain Foundation, Osmosis, Kujira, Babylon, Strangelove, and Odin. 

## Expertise

🔐 **Validator**: Equipped with over three years of experience as a validator, we currently secure networks like Ethereum, Osmosis, Kujira, and Odin. Our proficiency extends to many other Cosmos chains, evident in our contractual roles over the past year.

📡 **Network Participation**: Need to test a new version of your chain? We can assist in setting up, verifying start capability, and coordinating with a validator set for smooth chain launches or upgrades.

💻 **Node Operation**: Our reliable and scalable infrastructure assures your users of uninterrupted and seamless access to RPC / API endpoints.

🛠️ **Chain Tools**: We offer a dedicated block explorer, enabling users to conveniently view their transactions and balances. Additionally, we can provide a faucet for novice users. Visit [Defiant Explorer](https://explore.defiantlabs.net) for a sneak peak!

📚 **Documentation**: We understand the importance of documenting critical chain information. Our [Validator Docs](https://docs.defiantlabs.net/guides/cosmovisor) showcase our attention to detail.

🔄 **IBC Maintenance**: Our IBC expetise encompass the creation of new paths, relaying of existing paths, closing channels, fixing expired clients, flushing stuck packets, and more.

📊 **Tax Reporting**: If your users require cosmos activity reports, our [sycamore](https://docs.defiantlabs.net/products/sycamore) service can cater to this need.

🔧 **Custom Module Development**: We have developed a custom faucet module for osmosis, showcased at [x/faucet](https://github.com/DefiantLabs/osmosis/releases/tag/v15.0.0-faucet).

🧰 **Custom Tooling**: Our portfolio includes the creation of open-source tax tooling for the ICF, facilitated by Strangelove. Visit [cosmos-tax-cli](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/cosmos-tax-cli) for more details.
